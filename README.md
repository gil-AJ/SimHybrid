## SimHybrid
### A simulation and optimization tool for hybrid energy systems for educational purposes.
This tool presents a set of functions written in M language for use with MATLAB or Octave. These functions allow to simulate a hybrid energy system. In this first version, a stand-alone and a grid-connected system are taken into account, as well as the models of the elements of the system. In this first approach, the models are quite simple, however, the idea is to add more complex models, in order to vary the topology of the system.
