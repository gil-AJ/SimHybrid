## SimHybrid
### A simulation and optimization tool for hybrid energy systems for research purposes.
This tool presents a set of functions written in M language for use with MATLAB or Octave. These functions allow to simulate and to optimize a hybrid energy system. In this second version, a stand-alone and a grid-connected system are taken into account, as well as the models of the elements of the system.
